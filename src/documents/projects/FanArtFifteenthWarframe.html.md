*Digital painting created in Photoshop CS5 on a Surface Pro 2.*

Fan Art Fifteenth painting of everyone's favorite lobster-bottomed healer, Trinity,
 from Digital Extremes’ game, “Warframe.” This painting was one of the winners
 of the "Synergy" codex contest and is featured in the in-game codex (pictured bottom right)!
