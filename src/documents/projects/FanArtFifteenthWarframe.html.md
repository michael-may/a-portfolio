*Digital painting created in Photoshop CS5 on a Surface Pro 2.*

Fan Art Fifteenth painting featuring Saryn, my favorite ‘Frame,
 from Digital Extremes’ game, “Warframe.”

 Featured on Digital Extremes’ 56th episode of their Twitch.tv show, *Warframe
  Prime Time*, during the fan art portion. A screen capture is shown above
  right, but you can check it out on
   their Twitch page [*here*](http://www.twitch.tv/warframe/b/611563827) (it comes up at around the 44:28 mark).
