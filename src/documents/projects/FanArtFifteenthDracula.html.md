*Digital painting created in Photoshop CS5 on a Surface Pro 2.*

For October’s Fan Art Fifteenth, I decided to get into the spirit of Halloween and create a painting based on the vampire character, Dracula! Unlike the other pieces in my fan art series, there is such a wealth of different material for the Count that I didn’t use any one direct film reference or anything. Instead, I just created my own interpretation of the character, drawing inspiration from my favorite films and theories surrounding Dracula. I love the whole tragic/warrior/Vlad the Impaler Dracula character that shows up in films like Coppola’s “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” and “Dracula Untold,” so those were big influences.
