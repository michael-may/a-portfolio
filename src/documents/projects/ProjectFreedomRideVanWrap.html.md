*Digital paintings created in Krita and Affinity Designer.*

A wrap design created for a transport vehicle for Project Freedom Ride, featuring fun portraits of some of their animals along with their young, philanthropic founder, Roland (you might recognize him from the Dodo Kids YouTube channel).

On a related note, you can also check out some documentation for the van wrap that I created for the Bella Vista Animal Shelter a couple of years back [*here*](https://tmblr.co/ZmEH6t2QptTAc)!
