*Digital painting created in Photoshop CS5.*

Fan Art Fifteenth piece featuring Garrus of Bioware's game series, "Mass Effect."
Created early for N7 Day. To get into the spirit, I decided to paint Garrus against
 the backdrop of a burning Palaven as it appears in Mass Effect 3.

 Featured as the “Image of the Day” on ImagineFX’s website in early 2014 as pictured above right.
 You can find their Facebook post about it [*here*](https://www.facebook.com/imaginefx/photos/a.104969363817.91807.8362308817/10152173187928818/?type=1&relevant_count=1)!
