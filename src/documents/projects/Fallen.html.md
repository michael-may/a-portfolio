*Digital painting created in Photoshop CS5 with a Surface Pro 2.* 

Digital painting featuring some of my favorite religious/mythological creatures, angels and demons! 

Working with the concept of a fallen angel, I decided to go a slightly different route than some of my
 initial thumbnail sketches. While the demon's affection toward the angel could indicate that the corrupted 
 associations with the word are also true, it is her defeat on the hellish battlefield that was inspired by the 
 concept.
