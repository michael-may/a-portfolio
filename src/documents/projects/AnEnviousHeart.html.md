*Digital painting created in Photoshop CS5 on a Surface Pro 2.*

Many months ago, I got a request to do a witch themed painting. I started and
 restarted this piece, put it aside many times for other projects, but I’ve finally
  gotten around to finishing it.

Inspired (very loosely) by the Evil Queen from the Brothers Grimm’s “Snow White.” 
Using her poisoned apple and strong magic as a jumping off point and sprinkling 
in a dash of deep woods witch lore, I arrived at this- a piece focused on an untamed
 and powerful witch in the wilderness.
