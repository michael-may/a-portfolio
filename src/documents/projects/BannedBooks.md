*Digital illustration created in Procreate.*

As part of the Fayetteville Public Library’s participation in the annual Banned Books Week celebration across the nation, my illustration was selected by FPL Staff and the library’s Art Committee to be printed as one of five collectible cards! The piece, inspired by Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451,” will also be on display as a large print in FPL’s adult fiction wing.
