*Digital painting created in Photoshop CS5 on a Surface Pro 2 and Krita on a Surface Pro 4.*

Based on the fairy tale, "Red Riding Hood." The background for this was more dominant than in most of my work prior, giving me a chance to play around with landscape painting--something I have rarely explored. I put this one aside and picked it back up a number of times, so the process for it spans two sets of software and hardware.
