*Digital painting created in Krita on a Surface Pro 4.*

It’s taken a while to get back into things after labor complications required an extended hospital stay, but I’ve finally mostly healed up and gotten some time to paint again! Uploads are probably still going to be slower than usual, and there have been a couple of changes. I’m in the process of transitioning to new hardware and software for my paintings, so this piece was created in Krita on a Surface Pro 4. As a result, I can upload higher resolution process videos! There are still some paintings in the pipeline that will be a mix of old and new, but this piece was mostly experimentation to try to translate my workflow to the new gear.
