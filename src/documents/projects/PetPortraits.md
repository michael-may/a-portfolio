Top:
Illustrations for the children's book, [*"Faithful Furry Friends: Service Dogs."*](https://www.amazon.com/Faithful-Furry-Friends-Service-Dogs/dp/1735632317) Written by the Sisters and published by Pig Pen Publishing, the book and its friendly illustrations focus on educating children about the roles of service dogs and introducing kids to the rules surrounding interactions with on-duty service dogs.

Bottom:
A wrap design created for a transport vehicle for Project Freedom Ride, featuring fun portraits of some of their animals along with their young, philanthropic founder, Roland (you might recognize him from the Dodo Kids YouTube channel).
